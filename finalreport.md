# Trading Strategy Framework Report

## Project Overview

This project integrates multiple components for designing, testing, and evaluating algorithmic trading strategies. The framework consists of:

- **Signal Generation:** Various technical analysis-based strategies (RSI, SMA Crossover, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) in `TradingStrategy.py`.
- **Risk Management:** Position sizing, stop-loss, trailing stop-loss, VaR, CVaR, and mean-variance optimization in `riskmanage.py`.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Transaction history and current holdings via `PositionTracker.py` with a GUI interface (`PositionTrackerApp.py`).
- **Backtesting Engine:** Performance evaluation (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, cumulative returns) through `Backtester.py`.
- **Testing Framework:** Unit tests for strategies, risk metrics, and optimizers (`test_project.py`).

---

## Achievements

- Modularized signal generation using object-oriented design.
- Implemented risk controls, including position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms.
- Integrated mean-variance portfolio optimization (with and without shorting).
- Developed performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, VaR, and CVaR.
- Created a GUI application for manual position tracking with visualization.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Data Alignment Across Modules:**
   - Ensuring **synchronized timestamps** between signal generation, position tracking, and price data for backtesting.

2. **Risk-Return Tradeoff Complexity:**
   - **Combining tactical trading signals with portfolio-level optimization** (mean-variance) without overriding individual strategy logic.

3. **Stop-loss and Risk Metrics Integration:**
   - Balancing **per-trade stop-loss logic** with **portfolio-level risk metrics** like VaR and CVaR can be non-trivial, especially in overlapping trades.

4. **Limited Support for Multi-Asset Allocation:**
   - Current strategies are **single-asset focused**, while risk management and optimizers are designed for **multi-asset portfolios**.

5. **GUI-Quant Integration:**
   - The **Tkinter GUI (PositionTrackerApp.py)** operates independently from the quantitative modules, limiting seamless end-to-end automation.

---

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Backtesting Features:**
   - Add **transaction cost modeling**, **slippage**, and **leverage constraints**.
   - Include **position sizing logic in the backtest loop**.

2. **Advanced Risk Metrics:**
   - Incorporate **Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)** and **Omega Ratio** for deeper risk evaluation.
   - Extend **VaR/CVaR** to **multi-asset** portfolios.

3. **Strategy Enhancements:**
   - Implement **multi-factor strategies** blending momentum, volatility, and mean-reversion signals.
   - Explore **machine learning models** (XGBoost, LSTM) for adaptive signal generation.

4. **Portfolio Optimization Extensions:**
   - Integrate **risk parity**, **Black-Litterman models**, or **robust optimization**.
   - Support **dynamic rebalancing schedules** based on changing market regimes.

5. **Unified Framework with GUI:**
   - Expand the GUI to **incorporate signal generation and backtesting results** (not just manual transaction tracking).
   - Visualize **risk metrics (VaR/CVaR plots, drawdown curves)** directly in the app.

6. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Develop real-time **dashboarding** (e.g., with **Dash** or **Streamlit**) to monitor live strategy performance alongside risk metrics.

## Conclusion

This framework provides a solid foundation for **strategy research, risk management, and portfolio evaluation**. While core components are functional, there is room for improvement in **integration, scalability, and risk analysis depth**. Future enhancements aim to bridge the gap between tactical trading signals and portfolio-level risk control for robust real-world deployments.
