# Trading Strategy Framework Report

## Project Overview

This project integrates multiple components for designing, testing, and evaluating algorithmic trading strategies. The framework consists of:

- **Signal Generation:** Various technical analysis-based strategies (RSI, SMA Crossover, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) in `TradingStrategy.py`.
- **Risk Management:** Position sizing, stop-loss, trailing stop-loss, VaR, CVaR, and mean-variance optimization in `riskmanage.py`.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Transaction history and current holdings via `PositionTracker.py` with a GUI interface (`PositionTrackerApp.py`).
- **Backtesting Engine:** Performance evaluation (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, cumulative returns) through `Backtester.py`.
- **Testing Framework:** Unit tests for strategies, risk metrics, and optimizers (`test_project.py`).

## Achievements

* Modularized technical indicator-based strategy development using object-oriented design.
* Built a multi-strategy backtesting environment supporting **dynamic strategy selection** (9 strategies implemented).
* Developed a GUI application for **manual portfolio tracking** and  **strategy backtesting** , including performance plots.
* Implemented key performance metrics:  **Cumulative Return** ,  **Max Drawdown** , and  **Sharpe Ratio** .
* Added basic **transaction cost** adjustment in the backtesting flow (fixed-rate slippage model).

## Challenges Faced

1. **Signal-Execution Alignment:**
   * Required **careful shifting of trading signals** to simulate realistic execution on the next day's open.
2. **GUI and Quantitative Logic Separation:**
   * GUI was initially isolated; now partially integrated with strategy testing but **full end-to-end automation** is not complete.
3. **Strategy-Specific Data Requirements:**
   * Some strategies need full OHLCV data (e.g., MACD, ATR Breakout), requiring  **consistent data fetching and handling** .
4. **Handling Missing Data:**
   * Real-world Yahoo Finance data often includes missing fields; strategies must be robust to  **NaN values** .
5. **Transaction Cost Simplification:**
   * Trade cost currently assumed  **fixed 1.5%** , **dynamic slippage modeling** is still pending.

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Backtesting Engine:**
   * Add **dynamic position sizing** instead of fixed holdings.
   * Improve **transaction cost models** (different rates for buying/selling, spread impact).
2. **Advanced Risk Metrics:**
   * Implement  **VaR** ,  **CVaR** , and  **Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)** .
   * Extend Sharpe Ratio calculation to **adjust for risk-free rates** properly.
3. **Strategy Expansion:**
   * Add **Multi-Factor Strategies** (e.g., combining RSI + MACD + OBV).
   * Explore **basic ML strategies** (e.g., XGBoost classifiers for signal generation).
4. **GUI Upgrade:**
   * Allow users to **customize strategy parameters** (e.g., SMA short/long window, RSI window, ATR multiplier) directly from the GUI.
   * Integrate **performance reports and plots** into the app (no external matplotlib pop-up).
5. **Portfolio Optimization (Longer Term):**
   * Incorporate **mean-variance optimization** and **risk budgeting** for rebalancing.
   * Allow **multi-asset portfolio backtesting** with diversified signals.
6. **Automated Testing:**
   * Create a `test_project.py` to **unit test** major modules, especially TradingStrategy and Backtester classes.

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for  **technical strategy research** ,  **manual portfolio tracking** , and  **performance evaluation** . While already functional, further improvements in  **risk modeling** ,  **realistic execution simulation** , and **GUI-quant integration** will help move toward a professional-grade trading research platform.
